<h2> 1.1  The Elements of Programming </h2>

<p> A powerful programming language is more than just a means for instructing a computer to perform tasks. The language also serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Thus, when we describe a language, we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas. Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:

<ul>

<li> <b> primitive expressions, </b> which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,
<p>
<li> <b> means of combination, </b> by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
<p>
<li> <b> means of abstraction, </b> by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

</ul>

<p> In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data. (Later we will discover that they are really not so distinct.) Informally, data is "stuff" that we want to manipulate, and procedures are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and primitive procedures and should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.

<p> In this chapter we will deal only with simple numerical data so that we can focus on the rules for building procedures.4 In later chapters we will see that these same rules allow us to build procedures to manipulate compound data as well.

<h3> 1.1.1  Expressions </h3>

<p> One easy way to get started at programming is to examine some typical interactions with an interpreter for the Scheme dialect of Lisp. Imagine that you are sitting at a computer terminal. You type an expression, and the interpreter responds by displaying the result of its evaluating that expression.

<p> One kind of primitive expression you might type is a number. (More precisely, the expression that you type consists of the numerals that represent the number in base 10.) If you present Lisp with a number

<div id="scheme-number">
486
</div>

<p> the interpreter will respond by printing

<div id="scheme-number-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-number"); </script>

<p> Expressions representing numbers may be combined with an expression representing a primitive procedure (such as + or *) to form a compound expression that represents the application of the procedure to those numbers. For example:

<div id="scheme-plus-1">
(+ 137 349)
</div>
<div id="scheme-plus-1-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-plus-1"); </script>

<div id="scheme-minus">
(- 1000 334)
</div>
<div id="scheme-minus-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-minus"); </script>

<div id="scheme-times">
(* 5 99)
</div>
<div id="scheme-times-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-times"); </script>

<div id="scheme-divide">
(/ 10 5)
</div>
<div id="scheme-divide-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-divide"); </script>

<div id="scheme-plus-float">
(+ 2.7 10)
</div>
<div id="scheme-plus-float-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-plus-float"); </script>

<p> Expressions such as these, formed by delimiting a list of expressions within parentheses in order to denote procedure application, are called combinations. The leftmost element in the list is called the operator, and the other elements are called operands. The value of a combination is obtained by applying the procedure specified by the operator to the arguments that are the values of the operands.

<p> The convention of placing the operator to the left of the operands is known as prefix notation, and it may be somewhat confusing at first because it departs significantly from the customary mathematical convention. Prefix notation has several advantages, however. One of them is that it can accommodate procedures that may take an arbitrary number of arguments, as in the following examples:

<div id="scheme-plus-multiple">
(+ 21 35 12 7)
</div>
<div id="scheme-plus-multiple-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-plus-multiple"); </script>

<div id="scheme-times-multiple">
(* 25 4 12)
</div>
<div id="scheme-times-multiple-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-times-multiple"); </script>

<p> No ambiguity can arise, because the operator is always the leftmost element and the entire combination is delimited by the parentheses.

<p> A second advantage of prefix notation is that it extends in a straightforward way to allow combinations to be nested, that is, to have combinations whose elements are themselves combinations:

<div id="scheme-plus-times">
(+ (* 3 5) (- 10 6))
</div>
<div id="scheme-plus-times-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-plus-times"); </script>

<p> There is no limit (in principle) to the depth of such nesting and to the overall complexity of the expressions that the Lisp interpreter can evaluate. It is we humans who get confused by still relatively simple expressions such as

<div id="scheme-long-tree">
(+ (* 3 (+ (* 2 4) (+ 3 5))) (+ (- 10 7) 6))
</div>
<div id="scheme-long-tree-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-long-tree"); </script>

which the interpreter would readily evaluate to be 57. We can help ourselves by writing such an expression in the form

<div id="scheme-long-tree-pp">
(+ (* 3
      (+ (* 2 4)
         (+ 3 5)))
   (+ (- 10 7)
      6))
</div>
<div id="scheme-long-tree-pp-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-long-tree-pp"); </script>

<p> following a formatting convention known as pretty-printing, in which each long combination is written so that the operands are aligned vertically. The resulting indentations display clearly the structure of the expression.

<p> Even with complex expressions, the interpreter always operates in the same basic cycle: It reads an expression from the terminal, evaluates the expression, and prints the result. This mode of operation is often expressed by saying that the interpreter runs in a read-eval-print loop. Observe in particular that it is not necessary to explicitly instruct the interpreter to print the value of the expression.

<h3> 1.1.2  Naming and the Environment </h3>

<p> A critical aspect of a programming language is the means it provides for using names to refer to computational objects. We say that the name identifies a variable whose value is the object.

<p> In the Scheme dialect of Lisp, we name things with define. Typing

<div id="scheme-define">
(define size 2)
</div>
<div id="scheme-define-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-define"); </script>

<p> causes the interpreter to associate the value 2 with the name size.8 Once the name size has been associated with the number 2, we can refer to the value 2 by name:

<div id="scheme-size">
size
</div>
<div id="scheme-size-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-size"); </script>

<div id="scheme-times-size">
(* 5 size)
</div>
<div id="scheme-times-size-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-times-size"); </script>

<p> Here are further examples of the use of define:

<div id="scheme-circle">
(define pi 3.14159)
(define radius 10)
(* pi (* radius radius))
(define circumference (* 2 pi radius))
circumference
</div>
<div id="scheme-circle-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-circle"); </script>

<p> Define is our language's simplest means of abstraction, for it allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound operations, such as the circumference computed above. In general, computational objects may have very complex structures, and it would be extremely inconvenient to have to remember and repeat their details each time we want to use them. Indeed, complex programs are constructed by building, step by step, computational objects of increasing complexity. The interpreter makes this step-by-step program construction particularly convenient because name-object associations can be created incrementally in successive interactions. This feature encourages the incremental development and testing of programs and is largely responsible for the fact that a Lisp program usually consists of a large number of relatively simple procedures.

<p> It should be clear that the possibility of associating values with symbols and later retrieving them means that the interpreter must maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the name-object pairs. This memory is called the environment (more precisely the global environment, since we will see later that a computation may involve a number of different environments).

<h3> 1.1.3  Evaluating Combinations </h3>

<p> One of our goals in this chapter is to isolate issues about thinking procedurally. As a case in point, let us consider that, in evaluating combinations, the interpreter is itself following a procedure.

<blockquote> To evaluate a combination, do the following: 

<ol>

<li> Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
<p>
<li> Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of the other subexpressions (the operands). </ol> </blockquote>

<p> Even this simple rule illustrates some important points about processes in general. First, observe that the first step dictates that in order to accomplish the evaluation process for a combination we must first perform the evaluation process on each element of the combination. Thus, the evaluation rule is recursive in nature; that is, it includes, as one of its steps, the need to invoke the rule itself.10

<p> Notice how succinctly the idea of recursion can be used to express what, in the case of a deeply nested combination, would otherwise be viewed as a rather complicated process. For example, evaluating

<div id="scheme-tree-eg">
(* (+ 2 (* 4 6))
   (+ 3 5 7))
</div>
<div id="scheme-tree-eg-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-tree-eg"); </script>

<p> requires that the evaluation rule be applied to four different combinations. We can obtain a picture of this process by representing the combination in the form of a tree, as shown in figure 1.1.

<img src="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/ch1-Z-G-1.gif"> </img> <br>
<b> Figure 1.1 </b>:  Tree representation, showing the value of each subcombination.

<p> Each combination is represented by a node with branches corresponding to the operator and the operands of the combination stemming from it. The terminal nodes (that is, nodes with no branches stemming from them) represent either operators or numbers. Viewing evaluation in terms of the tree, we can imagine that the values of the operands percolate upward, starting from the terminal nodes and then combining at higher and higher levels. In general, we shall see that recursion is a very powerful technique for dealing with hierarchical, treelike objects. In fact, the "percolate values upward" form of the evaluation rule is an example of a general kind of process known as tree accumulation.

<p> Next, observe that the repeated application of the first step brings us to the point where we need to evaluate, not combinations, but primitive expressions such as numerals, built-in operators, or other names. We take care of the primitive cases by stipulating that

<ul>
<li> the values of numerals are the numbers that they name,
<p>
<li> the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences that carry out the corresponding operations, and
<p>
<li> the values of other names are the objects associated with those names in the environment. 
</ul>

<p> We may regard the second rule as a special case of the third one by stipulating that symbols such as + and * are also included in the global environment, and are associated with the sequences of machine instructions that are their ``values.'' The key point to notice is the role of the environment in determining the meaning of the symbols in expressions. In an interactive language such as Lisp, it is meaningless to speak of the value of an expression such as (+ x 1) without specifying any information about the environment that would provide a meaning for the symbol x (or even for the symbol +). As we shall see in chapter 3, the general notion of the environment as providing a context in which evaluation takes place will play an important role in our understanding of program execution.

<p> Notice that the evaluation rule given above does not handle definitions. For instance, evaluating (define x 3) does not apply define to two arguments, one of which is the value of the symbol x and the other of which is 3, since the purpose of the define is precisely to associate x with a value. (That is, (define x 3) is not a combination.)

<p> Such exceptions to the general evaluation rule are called special forms. Define is the only example of a special form that we have seen so far, but we will meet others shortly. Each special form has its own evaluation rule. The various kinds of expressions (each with its associated evaluation rule) constitute the syntax of the programming language. In comparison with most other programming languages, Lisp has a very simple syntax; that is, the evaluation rule for expressions can be described by a simple general rule together with specialized rules for a small number of special forms.11

<h3> 1.1.4  Compound Procedures </h3>

<p> We have identified in Lisp some of the elements that must appear in any powerful programming language:

<ul>
<li> Numbers and arithmetic operations are primitive data and procedures.
<p>
<li> Nesting of combinations provides a means of combining operations.
<p>
<li> Definitions that associate names with values provide a limited means of abstraction. 
</ul>

<p> Now we will learn about procedure definitions, a much more powerful abstraction technique by which a compound operation can be given a name and then referred to as a unit.

<p> We begin by examining how to express the idea of ``squaring.'' We might say, ``To square something, multiply it by itself.'' This is expressed in our language as

<div id="scheme-define-square">
(define (square x) (* x x))
</div>
<div id="scheme-define-square-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-define-square"); </script>

<p> We can understand this in the following way:

<p><p><tt>(define&nbsp;(square&nbsp;&nbsp;x)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8593&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8593&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8593&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8593&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8593&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8593<br>
&nbsp;To&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;square&nbsp;something,&nbsp;multiply&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;by&nbsp;&nbsp;itself.<br>
</tt><p><p>

<p> We have here a compound procedure, which has been given the name square. The procedure represents the operation of multiplying something by itself. The thing to be multiplied is given a local name, x, which plays the same role that a pronoun plays in natural language. Evaluating the definition creates this compound procedure and associates it with the name square.12

<p> The general form of a procedure definition is

<div id="scheme-define-syntax">
(define (name formal parameters) body)
</div>
<div id="scheme-define-syntax-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-define-syntax"); </script>

<p> The name is a symbol to be associated with the procedure definition in the environment.The formal parameters are the names used within the body of the procedure to refer to the corresponding arguments of the procedure. The body is an expression that will yield the value of the procedure application when the formal parameters are replaced by the actual arguments to which the procedure is applied.14 The name and the formal parameters are grouped within parentheses, just as they would be in an actual call to the procedure being defined.

<p> Having defined square, we can now use it:

<div id="scheme-square-number">
(define (square x) (* x x))
(square 21)
(square (+ 2 5))
(square (square 3))
</div>
<div id="scheme-square-number-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-square-number"); </script>

<p> We can also use square as a building block in defining other procedures. For example, x2 + y2 can be expressed as

<div id="scheme-sum-square-eg">
(define (square x) (* x x))
(+ (square x) (square y))
</div>
<div id="scheme-sum-square-eg-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-sum-square-eg"); </script>

<p> We can easily define a procedure sum-of-squares that, given any two numbers as arguments, produces the sum of their squares:

<div id="scheme-sum-square">
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (sum-of-squares x y)
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
(sum-of-squares 3 4)
</div>
<div id="scheme-sum-square-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-sum-square"); </script>

<p> Now we can use sum-of-squares as a building block in constructing further procedures:

<div id="scheme-f">
(define (square x) (* x x))
(define (sum-of-squares x y)
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
(define (f a)
  (sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2)))
(f 5)
</div>
<div id="scheme-f-output" class="output"> </div>
<script> createPrompt("#scheme-f"); </script>

<p> Compound procedures are used in exactly the same way as primitive procedures. Indeed, one could not tell by looking at the definition of sum-of-squares given above whether square was built into the interpreter, like + and *, or defined as a compound procedure.
